From Arthur C. Clarke's [The Nine Billion Names of God](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Nine_Billion_Names_of_God):

> “It is really quite simple. We have been compiling a list which shall contain
> all the possible names of God.”
> 
> “I beg your pardon?”
> 
> “We have reason to believe,” continued the lama imperturbably, “that all such
> names can be written with not more than nine letters in an alphabet we have
> devised.”
> 
> ...
> 
> “Call it ritual, if you like, but it’s a fundamental part of our belief. All
> the many names of the Supreme Being — God, Jehovah, Allah, and so on — they
> are only man-made labels. There is a philosophical problem of some difficulty
> here, which I do not propose to discuss, but somewhere among all the possible
> combinations of letters that can occur are what one may call the real names
> of God. By systematic permutation of letters, we have been trying to list
> them all.”
> 
> “I see. You’ve been starting at AAAAAAA... and working up to ZZZZZZZZ....”
> 
> “Exactly — though we use a special alphabet of our own. Modifying the
> electromatic typewriters to deal with this is, of course, trivial. A rather
> more interesting problem is that of devising suitable circuits to eliminate
> ridiculous combinations. For example, no letter must occur more than three
> times in succession.”
